  <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
  <p>
    zwh.tec built the Vorka app as a Free app. This SERVICE is provided by zwh at no cost and is intended for use as is.
  </p>
  <p>
    This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure of Personal Information if anyone decides to use my Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you choose to use my Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in relation to this policy. The Personal Information and content (including images) that I collect are used for providing and improving the Service, including the generation of AI-powered videos. I will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>
  <p>
    The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which are accessible at Vorka unless otherwise defined in this Privacy Policy.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
  <p>
    For a better experience, while using our Service, I may require you to provide us with certain personally identifiable information and content. This includes, but is not limited to, images you upload to the Service for the purpose of generating AI videos. The information and content I request may be temporarily stored on our servers to process your request and deliver the generated video. Personally identifiable information retained on your device is not collected by me unless explicitly uploaded as part of the Service.
  </p>
  <p>
    The images you upload will be used solely for the purpose of generating AI videos as requested by you. Once the video is generated and delivered, uploaded images may be retained for a limited period to improve our AI models or troubleshoot issues, unless you opt out of this retention (see "User Choices" below). After this period, the images will be deleted from our servers.
  </p>
  <div>
    <p>
      The app does use third-party services that may collect information used to identify you or process your uploaded content.
    </p>
    <p>

      <!-- Add additional third-party services here if applicable, e.g., AI processing providers -->
    </ul>
  </div>

  <p><strong>Log Data</strong></p>
  <p>
    I want to inform you that whenever you use my Service, in a case of an error in the app, I collect data and information (through third-party products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may include information such as your device Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the configuration of the app when utilizing my Service, the time and date of your use of the Service, and other statistics.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
  <p>
    Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's internal memory.
  </p>
  <p>
    This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third-party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services. You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.
  </p>

  <p><strong>User-Uploaded Content</strong></p>
  <p>
    When you upload images to our Service, they are processed by our AI systems to generate videos. We do not use your uploaded images for any purpose other than fulfilling your request and improving the Service, as described in this policy. Uploaded images are not shared with third parties except as necessary to process them (e.g., with secure third-party AI service providers). We take reasonable steps to protect your content during processing, but you acknowledge that uploading content is at your own risk.
  </p>

  <p><strong>User Choices</strong></p>
  <p>
    You may opt out of having your uploaded images retained for improving our AI models by contacting us at [email protected]. If you choose to opt out, your images will be deleted from our servers immediately after your video is generated and delivered.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
  <p>
    I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
    <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
    <li>To perform Service-related services (e.g., AI video generation);</li>
    <li>To assist us in analyzing how our Service is used.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to their Personal Information and uploaded content only to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. They are obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
  <p>
    I value your trust in providing us your Personal Information and uploaded content, thus we are striving to use commercially acceptable means of protecting it. This includes encryption during transmission and secure storage practices. However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Links to Other Sites</strong></p>
  <p>
    This Service may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note that these external sites are not operated by me. Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the Privacy Policy of these websites. I have no control over and assume no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or services.
  </p>

  <p><strong>Children’s Privacy</strong></p>
  <div>
    <p>
      These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information or uploaded content from children under 13 years of age. In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information or uploaded content, I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact me so that I will be able to take necessary actions.
    </p>
  </div>
